              <p>Since 2013, Egyptian courts have recommended initial death sentences for at least 10 children convicted in mass trials, often on trumped-up charges related to attending protests or the exercise of other fundamental rights. Sometimes, children are swept up by the authorities for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Children in Egypt aren’t just slipping through the cracks. A loophole in Egyptian law means that children as young as 16 can face trials in adult courts where a death sentence can be handed down. Combined with the ongoing crackdown on human rights and an explosion in the use of mass trials, children in Egypt are left especially vulnerable to death sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Sign our petition calling on Egypt to stop sentencing children to death in mass trials. We’ll be delivering that petition to the Egyptian embassy in London to show them that the world is watching. </strong></p><p>We have three key demands:</p><ul><li>release all children unlawfully sentenced to death</li><li>close the child death penalty loophole</li><li>end the use of mass trials</li></ul>

                  <p>Dear President el-Sisi,
We, the undersigned, call upon you to stop violations of children’s rights in Egypt and enact the following:</p>
<ul><li>Conduct a review of all death sentences handed down in Egypt since 2011 to identify:
</li>
<ul><li>all children who have been sentenced to death; and </li>
<li>all prisoners on death row whose trials did not meet international fair trial standards.</li>
</ul><li>Release all children in detention currently facing death sentences in Egypt;</li>
<li>Commit to commuting all death sentences for individuals whose trials did not meet international fair trial standards following a review of death row;</li>
<li>Identify all child defendants tried as adults and commit to retrying them in juvenile courts;</li>
<li>Close the loophole that allows children aged 16 and over to be tried as adults and face the death penalty;</li>
<li>End the use of mass trials, which violate international fair trial standards and deprive children of their rights.</li>
</ul></div>
